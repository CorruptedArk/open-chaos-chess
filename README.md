# open-chaos-chess
This repository is for an open sourced version of Chaos Chess, stripped of Google Play Services.

## Current Status
As of the most recent commit to the master branch, achievements and single player games are working.
However, since it is not using any online services, the progress is only saved locally and is lost if app data is wiped or if a player install on a new device.

## Upcoming Goals
The next goal I want to achieve for this project is multiplayer.
Currently, I'm looking into using Bluetooth for local multiplayer and using something like ice4j for multiplayer over NAT.
